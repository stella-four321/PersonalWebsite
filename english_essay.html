      <!-- First Essay -->
      <h3 class="w3-opacity fade-in w3-center" style = "padding-top: 40px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><b>Life is Only a Simulation</b></h3>
      <p class = "fade-in" style = "line-height: 2.5;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine the human consciousness stuck in a layer of dream, just like the dreams or nightmares humans have during their sleep, but without ever waking up from it. What if 
        humans live in a simulation? Everything you are feeling, learning, receiving from your five senses is merely a replica of code transmitting into our minds telling us that what we are experiencing is the reality. 
        However, can we trust it? This question brings us to the episode, “Playtest,” from the Black Mirror series directed by Trachtenberg. “Playtest” is a horror science fiction episode that uses horror elements to hint 
        that we all live in a simulation. The episode extrapolates our current technology to futuristic advancement in augmented video games that are indistinguishable from reality. The definition of “reality” is raised as events 
        are portrayed increasingly “real” which further questions our own “reality” if we’re also in a simulation.
      </p>
      <p class = "fade-in" style = "line-height: 2.5;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trachtenberg uses the sudden absence of surveillance camera footage to give the audience a sense of confusion in consciousness. The novum is the “mushroom” implanted on the back of Cooper’s neck that puts him in a 
        video game mode and makes him mentally projected with three-dimensional characters. Since the episode is mostly presented through Cooper’s eyes, the short clips of the camera footage gives the audience a sense of 
        reality check for the audience. For example, from 20:53 to 20:55, the sudden switch to the camera footage lets us know that the video game gopher is not real in reality, but just a mental projection from Cooper’s 
        mind instead. Another example would be in 36:28, where a giant disturbing spider comes in suddenly, and in 36:28 cuts to the camera footage so that the audience knows that the spider is not real. In the story, it is 
        pretty obvious for the audience to distinguish what is real and what is not from the exaggerated jumpscares, up until Sonja comes into play. Before Sonja, Cooper couldn’t physically touch the characters. However, 
        in 38:50, Cooper physically touched Sonja and got very confused realizing that she is “real.” He says, “you’re fucking real. You are real. You’re real. You’re Sonja. You’re actually here.” The repetition of the word “real” 
        and the close shot of Cooper’s confused facial expression makes the audience confused regarding the reality of Sonja. The audience is impatiently waiting for the camera footage to check if she is actually real or not. This 
        sudden absence of the camera footage in this section of the episode makes the audience paranoid, just like Cooper. We are unable to distinguish what is real and believe that Sonja is a real person. Only until when she becomes 
        eerie in 41:09 and gets her head torn out in 42:50 that the audience realizes she is just a mental projection from the game. If being able to physically touch something doesn’t confirm the thing is “real,” then how do we 
        affirm the things are “real” from this point on in the episode. This further makes the audience ponder upon our own reality and makes us wonder how to possibly confirm  the realness of the things that are touched.
      </p>
      <p class = "fade-in" style = "line-height: 2.5;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trachtenberg creates layers of consciousness to confuse the audience and makes us wonder if we’re also in a layer of unreality. Before Cooper enters the horror augmented reality 
        game, Katie describes their invention as “an interactive augmented reality system… like layers on top of reality” in 18:16 to 18:25. This is foreshadowing that there will be different layers of virtual worlds. As Cooper enters 
        the horror game, he encounters different scary characters. He starts to lose his mind and his memory about his mother and himself, and shouts “stop” multiple times at 51:21. His scream intensifies. The camera suddenly cuts to where 
        he wakes up in Shou Saito’s office, jumping out a layer of consciousness. Here, the audience thinks we are brought back to the “reality” world. The sudden jump to what we thought was the “reality” world gives the audience a sense of relief 
        since we are glad that Cooper is back to normal and regains his memory. In this layer, we see Cooper going back home to find his mom, but his mom forgets about him and says she has to call Cooper. While Cooper loudly shouts “mum,” we jump 
        back up to the first layer, the “reality” we were introduced to, where Cooper dies in the “white room” since his phone interfered with the implant. The contrast from the darkness, the obscurity of the haunted house and the bright whiteness 
        of the room in Shou Saito’s company is visually memorable for the audience which confirms the audience that we are back in “reality.” The sudden jumps from layers makes the audience feel a sense of confusion and paranoia as to unrealizing 
        when we are going to stop jumping to another layer of consciousness. As a philosopher states, “reality may thus contain many levels” (Bostrom, 2003, p. 12). Perhaps we are not yet in reality. Perhaps the audience is the one stuck in a layer 
        of consciousness and we don’t even realize it. Trachtenberg creates different layers to create a confusion for us that makes us wonder if we might also be stuck in a layer of simulation ourselves. Though everything seems so real to us, it 
        might also just be a mental projection where our consciousness is being controlled. 
      </p>
      <p class = "fade-in" style = "line-height: 2.5;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trachtenberg portrays the horror elements as growing in “realness,” which  makes the audience question the definition of “reality” itself. Similarly, Moravec (1998) believed that the human consciousness might be an “inaccurate 
        veneer rationalizing a mountain of unconscious processing”  and that the things we “perceive through our senses could be an elaborate hoax.” As Cooper enters the horror game, he encounters different scary characters, including 
        his bully in high school and a giant distorted spider. Up until Sonja comes into play, everything is only visual and auditory. When Sonja comes into play, he can now physically touch things and can feel physical pain. When everything 
        becomes more and more real, the audience feels a sense of paranoia and nervousness as there is more action between the projected characters and Cooper. The horror continues to build as Cooper starts to lose his mind and lose his memory 
        about his mother and himself. He can’t control himself, even Katie couldn’t control the gaming system anymore, as Cooper shouts “you’re not in control of this!” to Katie in 46:32,  resulting in Cooper’s memory being overwritten. When we 
        jump up a layer of consciousness, everything seems even more “real.” He takes the plane back to his house and sees his mother sitting on his bed. When Cooper realizes that his mother couldn’t remember his face, he gets concerned and shouts 
        “mum” trying to recall her memory of him. The “realness” portrayed as the episode goes on makes us question what the reality is. In the second layer, everything seems very normal, like what it would seem in reality. As a viewer, we are 
        incapable of distinguishing reality anymore. We lost control of what is “real.” The “reality” could just be an unreality that we think is real. 
      </p>
      <p class = "fade-in" style = "line-height: 2.5;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some might argue that everything that happens in the simulation is only from Cooper’s mind, like in a dream, where the director is trying to convey the danger of technology instead of hinting at the audience that we live in a simulation. 
        Although Katie says, “whatever is in there cannot harm you, ” Cooper is mentally already deeply affected and influenced by the game itself. Nowadays, we have our heads in our screens, endlessly consuming information and sucked in a world 
        conveniently offered by technology. The director uses Cooper going into the game mode to address our obsessive behavior of going into our “heads in our screen” mode.  For example, when Cooper forgets about his mother, about her name, her looks, 
        and eventually forgets who he is, it demonstrates that technology is taking over us. People create fictional characters of themselves made for the technological world and sometimes even lose track of who they are in reality. What is memory and 
        reality? What is consciousness? Cooper’s memory is being overwritten. When he looks in the mirror, he couldn’t recognize himself, which reminds us of how our generation is putting up makeup, filters, photoshop, and plastic surgery, etc. The director 
        sends a warning to the audience about how technology will eventually destroy our minds and consciousness. Through this, the director is able to not only confuse us about what is or isn’t reality in the story, but also make us aware of the dangerous 
        threats of technology that we are easily victims of.
      </p>
      <p class = "fade-in" style = "line-height: 2.5;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The episode “Playtest” uses horrific elements,  absence of camera footage, and layers of consciousness questions the definition of “reality.” Trachtenberg suggests the audience that humans might live in a simulation or a layer of consciousness that 
        they perceive as their reality. Trachtenberg portrays the future technology through a dystopian perspective as a way to warn the viewers of the dangers that they might create in the future and thus destroy humanity. It is also a hint to the viewers 
        that their consciousness is not “real.” Perhaps the viewers are just like Cooper in the episode, stuck in a layer of “unreality.”

      <!-- Second Essay -->
      <h3 class="w3-opacity fade-in w3-center" style = "padding-top: 40px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><b>Making Decisions in the Metafictional Realm</b></h3>
            
      <p class = "fade-in" style = "line-height: 2.5;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything we do in our lives is to try to reach a certain outcome or goal. We make different choices in the process of creating the outcome, which are similar to the assignments 
        we have been given in this English class, such as the argumentative essays, the class journals and the peer review. Students in this class, I included, gather information from reading 
        stories, watching films to then be able to make choices about what we want to write about or produce with the goal to complete the given tasks assigned by the professor. This decision-making 
        process closely resembles a “choose your own adventure” game. Although you have infinite options in front of you to choose from, the outcome always leads to one thing––the final product. 
        I am intrigued about how an adult makes approximately “35,000 remotely conscious decisions each day” (Hoomans, 2015) to reach multiple end goals throughout our lives. Even for this essay 
        to come together before the submission date on December 7th, I have spent time thinking about what I should and shouldn’t write about as I finish up my 14 days of quarantine in Taiwan. 
        Therefore, I have decided to look into the A0 introduction video, A3 essay, and A4 twine game to show the two main skills I learnt in this class––having an argumentative voice and making 
        the right decisions for finding reliable evidence and to demonstrate the multiple possibilities that come before the final outcome.

      <p class = "fade-in" style = "line-height: 2.5;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made different decisions during my writing process for my argumentative essay on the “Black Mirror” episode “Playtest.” My first decision was deciding on a science fictional text to write 
        about. I have a dozen of texts to choose from to write an essay on, however, I ended with “Playtest” because I am a huge fan of “Black Mirror” and was particularly interested in this episode. 
        Then, I have to choose from many topics to write about. I had a few in my mind, such as writing about ethicality in technology, living in a simulation, and second mysteries in the film, etc. 
        At first, I planned to write about the ethicality in futuristic technology in the episode and also talked to the professor about it. However, when I was constructing my paragraphs with my 
        ideas, nothing concretely lined up. What is great about the freedom of choices is that I can always go back one step and shift to another possible path that I find more suitable. I chose to 
        write about how the director is hinting to the audience about the idea that we are living in a simulation. Besides, when you read my essay, you would be able to tell that I was interested in 
        the “life is a simulation” topic from my intrigued tone of voice in the essay. The next path for me is to find evidence from the film. I have a document of quotations from the film that could 
        be possible evidence for my essay, which is a representation of different paths I could take. I constructed my body paragraphs with my ideas with various evidence and analyses. From there, 
        I have reached the end of the path––a completed assignment ready to be turned in.
      </p>

      <p class = "fade-in" style = "line-height: 2.5;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My essay could turn out so differently if any of my variables change. After submitting the assignment, I could not turn back. The choices have been made and the consequences, which is my grade, 
        will be determined in the near future. I believe that we are just like Stefan in “Bandersnatch.” The choices we make will always result in our end product, for Stefan, it is either death or prison, 
        whereas for me, it is a letter grade representing my skills. In the beginning of the semester, I made a video stating that I want to improve my oral skills in the WOVEN category and explained how 
        I planned to achieve my goal. One of my strategies was to talk more english in general. Due to the pandemic, I was stuck with four American roommates and I learned a lot from daily conversations. 
        Although classes have mostly been online, I still attended a few office hours, where I was able to practice my oral skills. I took this opportunity to talk to my instructor one-to-one to discuss my 
        ideas for assignments and ask for feedback. The pandemic is like a glitch in the simulation where there is a sudden change in the story and everything differs from what has been planned. But fear not, 
        due to the pandemic, I was able to improve other skills. I mostly improved on writing and connecting a specific genre of text to a theme or idea in an essay. For example, I wrote about how “Playtest” 
        is suggesting that we are in a simulation ourselves and questions the definition of “reality.” Because of a “glitch” in my learning process, I was able to focus on writing in the WOVEN category, 
        instead of my oral skills.
      </p>

      <p class = "fade-in" style = "line-height: 2.5;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my final project, I decided to create something different and fun. I made a twine game representing a metafictional story, “Happy Endings,” to depict the elements of metafiction, such as a parody, 
        a depiction of life, and the illusion of freedom. Since I was so passionate about my argument in my “Playtest” essay, I wanted to create a project where I was in control, where the players were under 
        my control. For once, during the process of making the twine game, I felt like the programmer of a simulation reality, or the person who programs our reality. I created this twine game not only as a 
        parody of “Happy Endings,” but also as a way to represent the theme of mortality and life. When playing my twine game, the player can choose to “fall in love with someone,” “not fall in love with someone” 
        or even “if the other person is falling in love with the player” As the programmer, I created multiple possibles that led to different storylines that then led to one static, unchangeable end. No matter 
        what paths the player chooses, their character in the twine game will always end up dead. Similarly, whatever choices we make during the process of writing an argumentative essay, we will always end with 
        a completed essay. During the making process, I have learned the features of the text genre through my own explorations.
      </p>

      <p class = "fade-in" style = "line-height: 2.5;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may argue that writing an essay isn’t like a “choose your own adventure” game because you can always go back and change your paths and there are other factors that could easily influence your paths. 
        For example, when a classmate reviews your essay and gives feedback, you can go back and change whatever needs to be changed to make your end result better. For me, my classmate gave me some constructive 
        comments on how my essay could have a counter-argument. I went back to my essay and added a strong counter-argument. Though it would not be ideal for a reader to go back steps and change the paths, it is 
        not illegal. I would argue that writing an essay is like a “build your own adventure” game in which variables take part strongly and can influence your paths easily. 
      </p>

      <p class = "fade-in" style = "line-height: 2.5;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every project or assignment I completed in this class made me feel like I was building my own stories, where I was in charge of making my own arguments and finding my evidence. I made different choices, went 
        through different paths, and had sudden variables that changed my decisions. I believe that I traveled into the world of metafiction while I was in the process of working on my assignments. With this mindset of 
        being in control of your own “choose your own adventure” game, I felt that I was more confident and audacious in coming up with arguments that spoke to me and allowed me to present my own voice more sincerely. 
        Even though my plans of improving my oral skills was interpreted by the pandemic, I showed my own argumentative voice and interests in the “Playtest” essay and the twine game project. I learned to write or 
        create based on a topic that interested me. Through that, I found the searching of specific evidence when I tried to support my arguments more natural and less forced. Although I am concluding my last assignment 
        for this class as I write these words, I will most definitely keep in mind the mindset of metafictions and remind myself to be daring and full of passion when choosing my paths when making decisions for my projects 
        and essays in the future.
